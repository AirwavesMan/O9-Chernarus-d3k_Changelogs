With the changes to the plot pole, we want to achieve several things. Firstly, we want to prevent the construction of several bases. Players who play closely together should have one core base and not each their own. We understand that many players still want to keep their own base, and we will not take action against this. In the coming updates, only players who are registered in the plot pole will be able to open the base doors. Furthermore, we will remove players who are duplicated in plot poles from these plot poles. This change will be added over the next few weeks. The second important point for these changes is the network performance. Door management and the storage of the associated player names and IDs on each door has a major impact on network performance. This leads to lags and rubberbanding on a server with many players. The elimination of door management gives us more leeway in network performance. And don't worry, you won't have to enter any door codes afterwards. If you have any questions about these changes, please post a ticket in the Discord.
