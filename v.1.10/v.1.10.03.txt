Changelog: v.1.10.03

- The taming of dogs has been deactivated, as it is extremely buggy.
- The convoys now spawn randomly on the map and have more spawn points.
- Players can no longer build on the road. This change is necessary so that convoys can drive on the roads without problems.
- The rules for claiming missions and convoys have been updated and expanded.
- Players who are already registered in a plot pole or have their own plot pole can no longer be registered in another plot pole.

This is just the start of some changes to the base concept. We don't want players who have played together in a group from the beginning to disregard the rule of one plot.
