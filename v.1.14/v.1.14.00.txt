Changelog: v.1.14.00

- After completing a mission, all mines should despawn immediately and no longer explode if a player enters the mission area very quickly with a vehicle, such as a helicopter.
- After the explosion of a mine in the minefield during a mission, there was a high chance that the mines were not deleted after completing a mission. This has been fixed.
