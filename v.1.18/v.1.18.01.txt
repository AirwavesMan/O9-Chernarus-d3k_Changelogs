Changelog: v.1.18.01

The following changes have already been added or fixed and are only listed here for completeness:

- The coin sound was too loud.
- When burying corpses, the coins could be looted several times.
- When gambling, vehicles won were not spawned in the virtual garage and disappeared completely.
- Vehicles that were spawned from the virtual garage via air spawn always spawned on the ground.
- Maintaining the virtual garage of a single player via the plot pole did not work.
- Ships in the coral reef are now refueled as soon as the fuel gauge is below 10%.
- The ship dealer now also has a service point.&lt;br/&gt;

The following changes are part of the new update:

- Ships can now be refueled automatically at the fuel station.
- Automatic refueling of helicopters is now also free of charge.
- Deleting AIs in the Safe Zone now works correctly again.
- Vehicles from AI missions no longer have a key. This has been changed so that there are no longer so many duplicate keys in use.

- Vehicles in the Safe Zone can no longer be lifted, towed or untowed if the player does not own the vehicle.
